# Popular Movies App

The project consists on building an app in two stages to allow users to discover the most popular contentValues playing, working with a themoviedb.org API.

This is the Stage 2 of the app.
## API Key
The app uses themoviedb.org API to get movie information. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app.

Just put your API key into `Gradle Scripts/gradle.properties`, under the format:

 `MovieApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY here"`
